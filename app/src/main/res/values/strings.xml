    <string name="game_explanation">The goal of the game is to create a maze with 15 pieces of food, 3 bombs and any
        number of walls. The algorithm then tries to programm the ant to complete the maze. The ant can only see
        directly in front of it, can only move forward and rotate by 90 degrees in any direction. If the ant reaches a
        bomb it dies. If eats all the pieces of food in a limited number of steps (100) it wins. At the end of the
        calculation you are given the time it took for the algorithm to crack the maze.
